Adthena Fullstack Assessment
========================

In this repository you will find the fullstack assessment skeleton project. It has react frontend and a dropwizard restful API.
An example code integration between the two can be seen in the "Task two" tab (TaskTwo.jsx) of the user interface when you run the projects. 

* The [test-client](test-client) folder contains the source code for the React frontend and a README on how to start that.
* The [test-api](test-api) folder contains the source code for the Dropwizard restful API and a README on how to start that.
