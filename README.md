Adthena Fullstack Assessment
========================

In this repository you will find the fullstack assessment skeleton project. 

* The [test-client](test-client) folder contains the source code for the React frontend and a README on how to start that.
* The [test-api](test-api) folder contains the source code for the Dropwizard restful API and a README on how to start that.

We recommend opening each of those folders as a separate project in your IDE (e. g. IntelliJ or VS Code).
An example code integration between the two can be seen in the "Task two" tab (TaskTwo.jsx) of the user interface when you run the projects.
